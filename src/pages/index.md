# Show off term

A very simple svg making API, that creates the following image

![term](https://show-off-term.vercel.app/api/code)

This image can be included in a Markdown file by inserting the following line

`![show-off-term](https://show-off-term.vercel.app/api/code)`

The API is being served of the Vercel serverless platform, but it can be used on any
other service
